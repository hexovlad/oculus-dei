# oculus-dei
An application for managing and monitoring attack surfaces. The main purpose is to create an application which is more or less plug and play for
non-technical people and allows organizations to manage and monitor their attack surface while also allowing for integrations with other 
applications such as _SIEM_ or _SOAR_.

In the documentation found here we should cover how to _install_, _use_ and _contribute_ to this project. Thanks for taking a look! :)
