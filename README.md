An application for managing and monitoring attack surfaces. The main purpose is to create an application which is more or less plug and play for
non-technical people and allows organizations to manage and monitor their attack surface while also sharing information with other
applications.

The documentation should cover how to _install_, _use_ and _contribute_ to the project.

**Thanks for taking a look! :)**
